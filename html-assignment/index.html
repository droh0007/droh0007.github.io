        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born on February 22<sup>nd</sup>, which turned out to be fairly crowded as I actually share my birthday with <em>two out of my three siblings!</em> I have a twin born on the same day and a younger siblings born on the very same day 8 years later. The youngest and luckiest in my opinion was born in March and broke our streak. </p>
        <p>I am a huge fan of all things spooky and cute, with year round Halloween decorations in my home but the rest dripping in pastel pink. I collect hobbies that range from crafting like building miniatures, making polymer clay jewelry or playing <abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&D</abbr> and collecting vintage toys. My happy place is a couch full of plushies, my cat and great horror movie.</p>
        <blockquote>Halloween wraps fear in innocence, as though it were a slightly sour sweet. Let terror, then, be turned into a treat.
